'Satisfactory Savegame Checker' v0.1 alpha
(c) 2019 SillyBits


'Satisfactory Savegame Checker' allows for checking satisfactory savegames and shows a dump on any damaged object found. Those damaged objects can then be removed using your favorite savegame editor.

It's solely written in Python (v3.5.3 as of now) and uses wxPython (v4.0.5 currently) for for all UI-related tasks.
It's open source and available for free at https://github.com/SillyBits/satisfactory-savegame-repairer/checking-only.
[You can also get ready-made executables in the download section at https://www.satisfactory-forum.de.]

Credits to bitowl, S4XXX and Goz3rr for their work on deciphering the structure of satisfactory savegames.


Cheers, and always remember:
 
We do not waste 
... so why waste a broken save if you can fix it :D
