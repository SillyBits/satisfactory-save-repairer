Credits to:
- bitowl, S4XXX and Goz3rr for their work on deciphering structure of satisfactory
savegames.

If this repairer is distributed as a ready-to-run Windows executable, further credits to:
- the pyinstaller team, used for creating the self-contained executable.

Cheers, and don't forget: We do not waste ... so why waste a broken save if you can fix it :D
